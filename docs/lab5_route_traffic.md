# Lab 5 - Getting Started

## Intended Traffic Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the **<font color="orange">flow of traffic within the network for this scenario</font>**. Traffic is initiated from the **Stockholm-User** and is first redirected to the **Singapore-Firewall** in a **<font color="green">VRF-2</font>** for <font color="orange">**inspection**</font>. After the traffic undergoes inspection, it is then forwarded to the **Sydney-User** in the **Sydney Branch**. 

This scenario demonstrates how traffic is securely routed through the firewall for inspection before reaching its final destination, ensuring that security policies are applied effectively within the SD-WAN fabric.
