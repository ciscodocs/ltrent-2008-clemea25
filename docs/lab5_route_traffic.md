# Lab 5 - Direct Internet Breakout for Sydney-Branch Traffic via Underlay with Firewall Inspection

## Introduction
In this lab exercise, you will explore the traffic flow from a user located in the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)** breakout directly to **<font color="green">Internet</font>** via underlay. Here is a breakdown of the key components involved in the network path: 

Here is a breakdown of the key components involved in the network path:

- **Source:** The traffic originates from a **Sydney-User** in the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)**.
- **Destination:** Internet for example **<font color="orange">Google DNS server 8.8.8.8</font>**.
- **Firewall:** All traffic passes through a **firewall (Sydney-FW)**, which is hosted locally at the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)** in **<font color="green">VRF-2</font>**.
- **WAN Edge Router:** The **Sydney-Branch** WAN-Edge router, router carries user traffic in ***<font color="#9AAFCB">VRF-1</font>***  and facilitates the firewall reachability in ***<font color="#9AAFCB">VRF-2</font>***. 

Ensure that each component is properly configured and verify the traffic flow is going through **Sydney-FW**.

!!! note
    Through this lab, firewall is configured to inspect traffic automatically in **inspected mode**, ***<font color="red"> without requiring any additional configuration</font>***. This inspection ensures that only safe and authorized traffic flows through the network, enhancing security and protecting against potential threats.

## Intended Traffic Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the **<font color="orange">flow of traffic within the network for this scenario</font>**. Traffic is initiated from the **Sydney-User** and is first redirected to the **Sydney-Firewall** in a **<font color="green">VRF-2</font>** for <font color="orange">**inspection**</font>. After the traffic undergoes inspection, it is then forwarded to the **Internet( for example Google <font color="green">DNS server 8.8.8.8</font>)**. 

This scenario demonstrates how traffic is securely routed through the firewall for inspection before reaching its final destination, ensuring that security policies are applied effectively within the SD-WAN fabric.

## Traffic flow without any policy

In the initial configuration, prior to applying any traffic policies or making modifications to the configuration group, it is observed that connectivity to the Internet, specifically to the **<font color="orange">Google DNS server 8.8.8.8</font>**, is not established from **VRF-1** on the **Sydney-Branch** WAN-Edge router. This lack of connectivity indicates that the current setup does not support direct Internet access from **VRF-1**, highlighting the need for further configuration, such as route adjustments, NAT settings, or centralized policies, to enable Internet reachability. This baseline observation provides a starting point for implementing the necessary changes in subsequent steps.
