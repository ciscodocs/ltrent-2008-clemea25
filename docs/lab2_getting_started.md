# Lab 2 - Route traffic from Stockholm to Sydney via London Firewall in same VRF

## Introduction

In this lab exercise, you will analyze the traffic flow between a user in the **<font color="Green">EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)</font>** and a user in the **<font color="Green">APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)</font>**, with the traffic routed through a **firewall** **<font color="Green">(London-Hub-Firewall)</font>** hosted at the 
**EMEA-London-Hub (site-101)**. The **London-Hub-Firewall**, accessible via the **London-Hub** WAN-Edge router in **<font color="blue">VRF-1</font>**, plays a critical role in inspecting and securing the traffic as it traverses the network. This exercise will focus on understanding the configuration and verification of service chaining, 
centralized policies, and the interactions between network elements to ensure the intended traffic flow through the designated security device.

Here is a breakdown of the key components involved in the network path:

- **Source:** The traffic originates from a **Stockholm-User** user in the **EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.
- **Destination:** The intended recipient is a **Sydney-User** in the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)**.
- **Firewall:** All traffic passes through a **firewall (London-FW)**, which is hosted locally at the **EMEA-London-Branch (site-101)**.
- **WAN Edge Router:** The **London-Branch** WAN-Edge router, configured in ***<font color="blue">VRF-1</font>***, facilitates the traffic's reachability to the firewall and subsequent routing towards the destination.

Ensure that each component is properly configured and verify the traffic flow is going through **London-FW**.

!!! note
    Through this lab, firewall is configured to inspect traffic automatically in **inspected mode**, ***<font color="red"> without requiring any additional configuration</font>***. This inspection ensures that only safe and authorized traffic flows through the network, enhancing security and protecting against potential threats.

## Intended Traffic Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the **<font color="orange">flow of traffic within the network for this scenario</font>**. Traffic is initiated from the **Stockholm-User** and is first redirected to the **London-Firewall** for <font color="orange">**inspection**</font>. After the traffic undergoes inspection, it is then forwarded to the **Sydney-User** in the **Sydney Branch**. 

This scenario demonstrates how traffic is securely routed through the firewall for inspection before reaching its final destination, ensuring that security policies are applied effectively within the SD-WAN fabric.

## Traffic flow without any policy

In the initial configuration, without applying any traffic policies, the routes learned from the **Sydney-Branch** are distributed equally across both TLOCs, leveraging ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) for optimal path selection.

To verify this, we initiate a ping from the **Stockholm-User** (**<font color="blue">IP: 192.168.10.2</font>**) to the **Sydney-User** (**<font color="blue">IP: 192.168.20.2</font>**). A successful ping response confirms that reachability between the two branches is intact.

Additionally, traffic originating from the **Stockholm-Branch** flows directly to the **Sydney-Branch** via the available TLOCs, ensuring efficient and balanced connectivity in the absence of traffic policies.

```{.ios, .no-copy}
Stockholm-User:~$ traceroute 192.168.20.2 -n 
traceroute to 192.168.20.2 (192.168.20.2), 30 hops max, 46 byte packets

 3  192.168.20.2  2.127 ms  9.074 ms  2.078 ms
```

!!! note
    In the traceroute above, we observe that the traffic is currently routed over the **MPLS** TLOC. However, it is also possible for the traffic to use the **INET** TLOC, as SD-WAN employs ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) to balance traffic across all available TLOCs.

Following Table exhibit how traffic is flowing from **Stockholm-User** to **Sydney-User**.

## Configuring Service-Chain in Configuration Group
Next, we will configure a service chain within the service-profile parcel in the configuration group by following the below setps. 
This service chain defines the sequence of services that will be applied to traffic originating from the **Stockholm-Branch** and destined 
for the **Sydney-Branch**. By specifying the service chain in the configuration, we instruct the **Stockholm WAN-Edge** on the type of services 
to be applied to the traffic, such as redirection through a **London-FW** firewall in **<font color="bluw">VRF 1</font>**. 
This configuration ensures that the desired service policies are enforced as traffic flows between the branches.

1. From the vManage Landing Page, navigate to the left-hand panel, select Configuration, and click Configuration Groups.

12. Enter **Service IPv4 Address <font color="blue">10.101.101.2</font>**. This is the IP address of **London Firewall (***<font color="green">London-FW</font>***)**.
13. Enter SD-WAN Router Interface as **GigabitEthernet4** and click <font color="orange">**Save**</font>.
    ![Service Attachment Gateway Definition](./assets/S-1-figure-14.png){ .off-glb }
    The **GigabitEthernet4** interface on the **London-Branch** WAN-Edge router serves as the connection point for the **London-FW firewall**. 
    This interface facilitates the integration of the firewall into the service chain, allowing traffic to be redirected through the firewall for inspection or policy enforcement as configured. The proper configuration of this interface is crucial for ensuring seamless communication between the WAN-Edge router and the firewall, enabling the desired security and traffic management features within the SD-WAN environment.
