# Troubleshooting commands

The following troubleshooting commands are essential tools for diagnosing and resolving issues related to service 
insertion and service chaining in an SD-WAN environment. These commands provide detailed insights into the configuration, 
operational status, and flow of traffic through service nodes, such as firewalls or other network services. 

By employing these commands, administrators/engineers/architects can efficiently identify and address misconfigurations, 
connectivity issues, or policy-related discrepancies. Additionally, documenting these commands as part of your operational toolkit ensures 
they are readily available for future debugging scenarios, streamlining the troubleshooting process and maintaining 
network performance and reliability.
