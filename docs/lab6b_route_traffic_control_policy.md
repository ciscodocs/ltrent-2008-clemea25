# Lab 6b - Route traffic from Sydney to Stockholm via remote firewall in Stockholm in same VRF using <font color="grey">**Control Policy**</font>

## Introduction

In this lab exercise, you will explore the traffic flow from a user located in the **EMEA-Sydney-Branch (site-20)** to a user situated at the **APAC-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.

Here is a breakdown of the key components involved in the network path:

- **Source:** The traffic originates from a **Sydney-User** user in the **EMEA-Sydney-Branch (site-20)**.
- **Destination:** The intended recipient is a **Stockholm-User** in the **APAC-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.
- **Firewall:** All traffic passes through a **firewall (Stockholm-FW)**, which is hosted locally at the **EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.
- **WAN Edge Router:** The **Stockholm-Branch** WAN-Edge router, configured in ***<font color="#9AAFCB">VRF-1</font>***, facilitates the traffic's reachability to the firewall and subsequent routing towards the destination.

Ensure that each component is properly configured and verify the traffic flow is going through **Stockholm-FW**.

!!! note
    Through this lab, firewall is configured to inspect traffic automatically in **inspected mode**, ***<font color="red"> without requiring any additional configuration</font>***. This inspection ensures that only safe and authorized traffic flows through the network, enhancing security and protecting against potential threats.

## Intended Traffic Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the **<font color="orange">flow of traffic within the network for this scenario</font>**. Traffic is initiated from the **Sydney-User** and is first redirected to the **Stockholm-Firewall** for <font color="orange">**inspection**</font>. 
After the traffic undergoes inspection, it is then forwarded to the **Stockholm-User** in the **Stockholm Branch**. This scenario demonstrates how traffic is securely routed through the firewall for inspection before reaching its final destination, ensuring that security 
policies are applied effectively within the SD-WAN fabric.

## Traffic flow without any policy

In the initial configuration, without applying any traffic policies, the routes learned from the **Stockholm-Branch** are distributed equally across both TLOCs, leveraging ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) for optimal path selection.

To verify this, we initiate a ping from the **Sydney-User** (**<font color="#9AAFCB">IP: 192.168.20.2</font>**) to the **Stockholm-User** (**<font color="#9AAFCB">IP: 192.168.10.2</font>**). 
A successful ping response confirms that reachability between the two branches is intact.

```{.ios, .no-copy}

```
Additionally, traffic originating from the **Sydney-Branch** flows directly to the **Stockholm-Branch** via the available TLOCs, 
ensuring efficient and balanced connectivity in the absence of traffic policies.

```{.ios, .no-copy}
Sydney-User:~$ traceroute 192.168.10.2 -n
traceroute to 192.168.10.2 (192.168.10.2), 30 hops max, 46 byte packets

 3  192.168.10.2  1.575 ms  2.458 ms  1.601 ms
```

!!! note
    In the traceroute above, we observe that the traffic is currently routed over the **INET** TLOC. However, it is also possible for the traffic to use the **MPLS** TLOC, as SD-WAN employs ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) to balance traffic across all available TLOCs.

Following Table exhibit how traffic is flowing from **Sydney-User** to **Stockholm-User**.

## Configuring Service-Chain in Configuration Group

Next, we will configure a service chain within the service-profile parcel in the configuration group by following the
below steps. This service chain defines the sequence of services that will be applied to traffic originating
from the **Sydney-Branch** and destined for the **Stockholm-Branch**. By specifying the service chain in the
configuration, we instruct the **Sydney WAN-Edge** on the type of services to be applied to the traffic,
such as redirection through a firewall. This configuration ensures that the desired service policies are enforced
as traffic flows between the branches.

!!! note
    Since the firewall is hosted on the **Stockholm-Branch** WAN-Edge router, it is essential to define the firewall service
    within the configuration group of the **<font color="green">Stockholm-Branch</font>** WAN-Edge router. This step ensures that the service is recognized
    and integrated into the SD-WAN topology, allowing traffic to be correctly routed through the firewall as part of the
    service chain. By specifying the service in the configuration group, the firewall's role in traffic inspection and
    redirection is clearly defined and operationalized within the branch's network setup.

## Verification of Service Chain configuration on Stockholm-Branch

In the Cisco SD-WAN architecture, service nodes communicate their available services to the **SD-WAN Controller (vSmart)**
using the **Overlay Management Protocol (OMP)** with the service route address family. Each WAN-Edge router is responsible
for advertising its service routes to the SD-WAN Controller (vSmart), which then maintains these service routes
within its **Routing Information Base (RIB)**.

**<font color="green">Notably, the SD-WAN Controller (vSmart) controller does not propagate these service routes to
other WAN-Edge routers within the SD-WAN fabric</font>**. Instead, the service label, which is advertised in the service
route to the SD-WAN Controller (vSmart), plays a crucial role. If traffic destined for a particular vRoute needs to
traverse a service, the SD-WAN Controller (vSmart) controller replaces the vRoute’s label with the service label.

## Configuring Centralized Control policy for Traffic Steering

The SD-WAN control policy named **scenario-6-cp** is crafted to dynamically steer traffic by utilizing route and site matching criteria. 
This policy is configured to specifically match routes advertised by the **Stockholm site** (<font color="green">**site-id 10**</font>) that belong to the **Stockholm user subnet** <font color="green">**192.168.10.0/24**</font>. 
Once matched, the policy directs these routes towards the **Stockholm Firewall** for inspection. The control policy is applied to the control-plane advertisements leaving the **Sydney** site (<font color="green">**site-id 20**</font>), ensuring that traffic destined for the **Stockholm-Branch** site (<font color="green">**site-id 10**</font>) follows the desired path through the **<font color="green">Stockholm Firewall</font>**, enabling enhanced traffic management and security enforcement.

1. To begin configuring the centralized data policy, navigate to the left-hand pane in the SD-WAN Manager (vManage) interface. From there, select Configuration, followed by Classic, and then click on Policies.

10. In this step, we create a sequence within the control policy to handle routes specific to **Stockholm-Branch** user traffic. This sequence matches the routes belonging to 
    the **Stockholm-Branch** **<font color="green">user subnet (<font color="green">192.168.10.0/24</font>)</font>** and sets the next hop to the **Stockholm-Branch TLOC (<font color="green">biz-internet:10.1.1.1</font>)**. 
    This TLOC is configured to direct traffic towards the **Stockholm-Branch Firewall (FW)**, ensuring that all matched traffic is routed through the firewall for inspection and policy enforcement. 
    This configuration is a critical step in defining how traffic is dynamically steered within the SD-WAN environment to meet security and routing requirements.

11. Now, click **Sequence Rule** and select **Match** to define the criteria for the control policy. In this step, we configure the policy to match routes based on a specific 
    site-id and a designated prefix-list. The site-id used in this control policy corresponds to **Stockholm-Branch** (<font color="green">**site-id 10**</font>), ensuring the 
    policy applies only to traffic originating from this site. Additionally, the prefix-list selected for the control policy is **Stockholm-Branch-User-Subnet**, which includes 
    the subnet <font color="green">**192.168.10.0/24**</font>. This configuration ensures precise targeting of routes for the desired traffic steering behavior.

12. Next, click **Action** and select **Accept** to define the behavior of the control policy for matched routes. Once the action is set to **Accept**, proceed to configure the 
    **Service** by selecting <font color="green">Firewall</font> from the dropdown menu. This step ensures that the traffic will be steered through the designated firewall service.
    Specify the **VPN** where the firewall is hosted — in this topology, the VPN is <font color="green">1</font>. Under the TLOC IP section, input the TLOC IP address 
    **<font color="green">10.1.1.1</font>**, and select the color as **biz-internet** and Encapsulation as **IPSEC**. These configurations direct the traffic through the 
    appropriate TLOC path, ensuring secure and optimized routing through the firewall.

13. Once the match conditions and actions are fully configured, click **Save Match and Actions** to finalize the rule. This step ensures that the defined criteria and corresponding 
    actions are stored within the control policy. By saving, you confirm the rule’s configuration, making it ready to be included in the policy sequence.

14. Now click **Next** and as we are NOT configuring any **Traffic Rules** so we click **Next** again. After that we land to **Apply Policies to Sites and VPNs** section.

15. Under **Topology** section click **New Site/WAN Region List**.

16. Make sure we select **Site List** and under **Outbound Site List**, we select **<font color="green">Sydney-Branch</font>**. So intent of the control policy is to select
    when SD-WAN Controller (vSmart), advertised the routes of **<font color="orange">Stockholm-Branch</font>** more specifically **<font color="orange">Stockholm-Branch-User</font>**, we set the TLOC of **Stockholm-Branch** and advertised towards the
    **Sydney-Branch**, as policy is applied in **<font color="green">outbound</font>** direction. Once **Sydney-Branch** is selected from **Outbound Site List**, we select **Add**. So
    configuration of the direction is saved under control policy like below.

17. To complete the control policy setup, configure the policy name and description. Enter **<font color="green">scenario-6</font>** as the name and description.

## Verification

After the successful deployment of the centralized control policy <font color="green">**scenario-6**</font>, it is essential 
to verify its application on the **SD-WAN controller (vSmart)** and confirm that routes are being propagated according to the 
policy. Specifically, we need to ensure that the **Sydney-Branch** WAN-Edge has received the **Stockholm-Branch user routes** with 
the **Stockholm-Branch** TLOC as defined in the policy. This verification can be performed using the following show commands on 
the **SD-WAN Controller(vSmart)**. These commands allow us to confirm the correct route advertisements and validate that the 
policy is functioning as intended.

```
After activating the centralized control policy, we can observe that the **Stockholm-Branch** user subnet **<font color="green">192.168.10.0/24</font>** is 
now associated exclusively with the **Stockholm-Branch TLOC** (**<font color="green">biz-internet:10.1.1.1</font>**) as per the 
policy configuration. This behavior contrasts with the earlier state, prior to applying the control policy, where the same 
subnet **<font color="green">192.168.10.0/24</font>** was advertised with **both Stockholm-Branch TLOCs** (<font color="orange">**biz-internet, mpls**</font>). 
This change demonstrates the effectiveness of the centralized control policy in steering traffic dynamically by modifying route advertisements to align with the desired topology.
