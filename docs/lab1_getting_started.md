# Lab 1 - Route traffic from Stockholm to Sydney via local firewall in Stockholm

## Introduction

In this lab exercise, you will explore the traffic flow from a user located in the **EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)** to a user situated at the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)**.

Here is a breakdown of the key components involved in the network path:

- **Source:** The traffic originates from a **Stockholm-User** user in the **EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.
- **Destination:** The intended recipient is a **Sydney-User** in the **APAC-Sydney-Branch (site-20)**.
- **Firewall:** All traffic passes through a **firewall (Stockholm-FW)**, which is hosted locally at the **EMEA-Stockholm-Branch (site-10)**.
- **WAN Edge Router:** The **Stockholm-Branch** WAN-Edge router, configured in ***<font color="blue">VRF-1</font>***, facilitates the traffic's reachability to the firewall and subsequent routing towards the destination.

Ensure that each component is properly configured and verify the traffic flow is going through **Stockholm-FW**.

!!! note
    Through this lab, firewall is configured to inspect traffic automatically in **inspected mode**, ***<font color="red"> without requiring any additional configuration</font>***. This inspection ensures that only safe and authorized traffic flows through the network, enhancing security and protecting against potential threats.

## Intended Traffic Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the **<font color="orange">flow of traffic within the network for this scenario</font>**. Traffic is initiated from the **Stockholm-User** and is first redirected to the **Stockholm-Firewall** for <font color="orange">**inspection**</font>. After the traffic undergoes inspection, it is then forwarded to the **Sydney-User** in the **Sydney Branch**. This scenario demonstrates how traffic is securely routed through the firewall for inspection before reaching its final destination, ensuring that security policies are applied effectively within the SD-WAN fabric.

## Traffic flow without any policy

In the initial configuration, without applying any traffic policies, the routes learned from the **Sydney-Branch** are distributed equally across both TLOCs, leveraging ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) for optimal path selection.

```

To verify this, we initiate a ping from the **Stockholm-User** (**<font color="blue">IP: 192.168.10.2</font>**) to the **Sydney-User** (**<font color="blue">IP: 192.168.20.2</font>**). A successful ping response confirms that reachability between the two branches is intact.

```
Additionally, traffic originating from the **Stockholm-Branch** flows directly to the **Sydney-Branch** via the available TLOCs, ensuring efficient and balanced connectivity in the absence of traffic policies.

```{.ios, .no-copy}
Stockholm-User:~$ traceroute 192.168.20.2 -n 
traceroute to 192.168.20.2 (192.168.20.2), 30 hops max, 46 byte packets

 3  192.168.20.2  2.551 ms  2.358 ms  1.750 ms
```

!!! note
In the traceroute above, we observe that the traffic is currently routed over the **INET** TLOC. However, it is also possible for the traffic to use the **MPLS** TLOC, as SD-WAN employs ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) to balance traffic across all available TLOCs.

Following Table exhibit how traffic is flowing from **Stockholm-User** to **Sydney-User**.

## Configuring Service-Chain in Configuration Group

Next, we will configure a service chain within the service-profile parcel in the configuration group by following the below setps. This service chain defines the sequence of services that will be applied to traffic originating from the **Stockholm-Branch** and destined for the **Sydney-Branch**. By specifying the service chain in the configuration, we instruct the **Stockholm WAN-Edge** on the type of services to be applied to the traffic, such as redirection through a firewall. This configuration ensures that the desired service policies are enforced as traffic flows between the branches.

## Verification of Service Chain configuration on Stockholm-Branch
In the Cisco SD-WAN solution, each **VRF/VPN** is treated as a service, including **firewall services**. These services are advertised across the SD-WAN fabric using the OMP (Overlay Management Protocol). 

When the firewall service was introduced on the **Stockholm Branch** router, the router assigned a **label (e.g., 1009)** to the firewall service and advertised this label to the **SD-WAN controller (vSmart)** through OMP. As a result, all WAN-Edge routers within the SD-WAN fabric are aware that to access the firewall service located at the **Stockholm Branch**, they must use the **label 1009**. This mechanism ensures efficient service discovery and routing across the SD-WAN environment.

To verify the service chain configuration on the **Stockholm-Branch** WAN-Edge router, access the device CLI and execute the command:

- **show platform software sdwan service-chain database**. 

Review the output to confirm the following details: the **<font color="green">Service Chain ID (e.g., SC7)</font>**, the **<font color="green">VRF (e.g., vrf: 1)</font>**, and the State, which should display **UP** to indicate proper functionality. 

Additionally, verify that the Service is set to **<font color="green">FW (Firewall)</font>**, the TX and RX interface is **GigabitEthernet4**, and the associated IP address is **10.10.10.2**. This verification ensures that the service chain configuration is active and correctly aligned with the intended design.
