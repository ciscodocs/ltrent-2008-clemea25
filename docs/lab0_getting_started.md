# Initial Topology and verification

## Introduction
This lab features a topology comprising four WAN-Edge routers strategically deployed across two regions: EMEA and APAC. In the EMEA region, the routers are located in London and Stockholm, while in the APAC region, they are deployed in Singapore and Sydney. Each WAN-Edge router is integrated with a firewall, which is essential for redirecting traffic for inspection across various use cases. The deployment leverages two transport types—Internet and MPLS—to provide reliable connectivity between the WAN-Edge routers across regions. This setup creates a robust environment for simulating real-world traffic routing and inspection scenarios.
