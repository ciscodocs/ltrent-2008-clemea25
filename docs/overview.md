# Overview

## Learning Objectives

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving IT landscape, optimizing network performance, security, and cost-efficiency is paramount. Cisco's Catalyst SD-WAN offers powerful solutions to achieve these goals, but mastering advanced techniques like route leaking and service insertion is essential for maximizing its capabilities. This hands-on lab is designed for network architects and engineers who are looking to deepen their understanding and practical skills with Catalyst SD-WAN.

## Key Lab Focus Areas
- ***Route Leaking for Seamless VPN Communication:***

  Route leaking enables efficient traffic flow between different VPNs, allowing for a more streamlined communication process while optimizing the use of available routes. This lab will guide you through the implementation of route leaking techniques, ensuring VPNs can communicate effectively without sacrificing performance or security.

- ***Service Insertion for Network Optimization:***

  Service insertion involves embedding essential network services such as security, monitoring, or optimization directly into the SD-WAN architecture. Learn best practices for inserting services within both data centers and local sites, improving both efficiency and security while managing complex infrastructures.

## Disclaimer

This training document is to familiarize participants with SD-WAN route leaking and service insertion. The lab design and configuration examples are tweaked to illustrate the lab content and are not a real design, thus not all recommended features are used, or enabled optimally.
